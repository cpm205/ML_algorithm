It is a technique we use in Machine Learning and Deep Learning is to normalize our data. 
It often leads to a better performance because gradient descent converges faster after normalization.

"""
 Implement normalizeRows() to normalize the rows of a matrix. 
 After applying this function to an input matrix x, each row of x should be a vector of unit length (meaning length 1).
